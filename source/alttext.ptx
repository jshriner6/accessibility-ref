    <title>Writing Alt Text and Descriptions</title>
    <p>
      Alt text should convey the purpose of an image. It's possible that two different instructors use the same image to 
      convey different information. In this case, their alternative texts for the image would not be exactly the same. Alt
      text should be concise (around 120 characters or less). If an image is complex and cannot be adequately described with 
      alt text, you can include a long description directly in the text next to the image, or link to a separate document. 
      Long descriptions can include more formatting when necessary, like headings, lists, and tables. If an image is
      adequately described in the text, the alt text can just point users to the surrounding text for the description. If
      an image is present solely for decorative purposes, it can be marked as such.
    </p>
    <p>
      AI can be a helpful aid in generating image descriptions. As a starting point, you may try submitting your image with
      a prompt like <q>generate an alternative text for this image</q>. Since only you know your intent for the image, you 
      will likely want to modify the output.

    <title>Adding Alt Text and Descriptions to Images</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        How alternative text is added to an image will vary depending what you are using to create your document. We've
        included some common cases below.
      </p>
    </introduction>
      <subsubsection xml:id="alt-pretext">
        <title>PreTeXt</title>
        <p>
          Alt text can be added with the <tag>shortdescription</tag> tag, while long descriptions can be added with the
          <tag>description</tag> tag. An image can be marked decorative by setting <c>decorative="yes"</c> as an attribute of the image.
          This is outlined in the <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/overview-images.html#overview-images-9">images 
            overview of the PreTeXt guide</url>.
