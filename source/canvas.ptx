    <title>Using the Canvas Editor</title>
      <p>
        When typing math in Canvas, you can type LaTeX code directly in the equation editor, which will render the output 
        in an accessible format (using MathJax). 
      </p>
      <p>
        When authoring pages in Canvas, be sure to use the provided options for headings, lists, and tables (as opposed 
        to creating your own formatting). This will ensure the page is created in a way that is accessible to screen readers.
