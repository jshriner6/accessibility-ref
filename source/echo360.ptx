          Minimal to significant. This can vary depending on how/if you're creating your videos, how long they are, and 
          how much you need to edit.

    <title>Echo360 Hosting</title>
      We are emphasizing Echo360 since this is the platform provided by default in Canvas. There are other hosting platforms
      that behave similarly.

        <title>Captioning and Transcripts</title>
        <p>
          When you upload or record video using a hosting platform like Echo360, it will auto-generate captions and 
          a transcript. These are separate files, but should generally convey the same information about the audio in the
          video. The auto-generated files often contain errors that may lead to confusion, so they should be reviewed and 
          edited for accuracy. One workflow in Echo360 is to find your video and select <q>Edit Transcript</q>. Once your transcript
          is edited, you can then select <q>Apply to CC</q> to also update the caption file.

        <title>Audio Description</title>
        <p>
          Audio description files are a narration of meaningful visual information in a video to provide context, 
          clarify speakers, and articulate visual elements (like alternative text for videos). If you are creating new videos,
          it is good to think about how you might articulate meaning and avoid certain presentation styles so that 
          such an additional file would not be necessary. If you are using existing videos where such a file would be useful, 
          you can add an audio file in Echo360 by (HOW DO YOU DO THIS? I don't see the "Accessibility" option in media details)
