        <p>
          Create new documents in HTML, which is generally the most accessible format. These
          options are also good for authoring documents in which you'd like to have an HTML version for posting, and a PDF 
          version for printing.

          Minimal to significant. This will vary based on the platform used, so we address this separately in each 
          subsection below.

        <title>Time Commitment</title>
        <p>
          Moderate to significant. For basic documents like syllabi or notes with only text and math, there is a moderate
          commitment to learning the initial setup and syntax (which is XML). To learn more of the capabilities of PreTeXt would be a 
          significant time commitment.

      <p>
        The main benefit of PreTeXt is that it allows you to author your document once, and then build your output in a 
        variety of formats, including HTML (for posting an accessible version) and PDF (for printing). A common use case would
        be to use PreTeXt to author guided notes for class, in which an accessible version can be posted on Canvas and a PDF 
        version can be printed for class.

      <p>
        There is a detailed <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/guide-toc.html">PreTeXt guide</url> and an 
        <url href="https://pretextbook.org/examples/sample-article/annotated/frontmatter.html">annotated sample article</url>,
        which are great references to access when you want to learn more. To get started quickly with a basic document, you
        can follow the directions in the <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/tutorial.html">Getting Started Tutorial</url>.
        You can create, edit, and publish documents all through Github with no need for local installations.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/online-style.html">multiple themes</url> you can use, depending on what type of document you are creating.
        PreTeXt can also integrate with many other tools to make your document more interactive, including Sage and Desmos. You can
        find a complete list, with examples, starting in <url href="https://pretextbook.org/examples/sample-article/annotated/section-interactive-authored.html">Chapter 14</url>
        of the annotated sample article.

        <url href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</url> shares the same benefit as PreTeXt in that you can write your document
        once and use it to produce an output in multiple formats. I have not used Quarto, but I'm told the syntax feels like 
        a mashup between LaTeX and Markdown. For some, this may be a reason to prefer this over PreTeXt. If you use it and 
        find a good workflow, please share it so we can post it here.

        <url href="https://math.nist.gov/~BMiller/LaTeXML/">LaTeXML</url> accepts a .tex file and outputs an HTML file. This
        is what is currently being used by <url href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</url> to provide HTML versions of papers. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This requires a <url href="https://math.nist.gov/~BMiller/LaTeXML/get.html">local installation</url>, and can be run
        <url href="https://math.nist.gov/~BMiller/LaTeXML/ussage.html">using a single command</url> from your computer's terminal.
