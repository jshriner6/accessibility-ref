    <title>Finding Existing Textbooks</title>
        <p>There are numerous existing open source textbooks available in mathematics. The American Institute of Mathematics
           maintains a <url href="https://textbooks.aimath.org/textbooks/approved-textbooks/">list of approved textbooks</url>. 
           <url href="https://danaernst.com/resources/free-and-open-source-textbooks/">Dana Ernst's list</url> 
           also has textbooks covering a variety of topics. An internet search for a specific topic may also be fruitful. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Be aware that "open source" does not imply "accessible", so it is necessary to evaluate these texts for accessibility. 
          Textbooks that have an HTML option will, in general, be more accessible than textbooks that are 
          available only as a PDF.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modifying open source materials will vary based on how they were created. Look for instructions from the original
          author regarding creating derivatives of the original work.
