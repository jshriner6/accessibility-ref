    <title>PreFigure Images</title>
      <p>
        <url href="https://prefigure.org/">PreFigure</url> is an authoring system for mathematical images where the focus
        is on describing the meaning and purpose of the image. This allows for the creation of images that are very accessible,
        and can also be rendered in a tactile format.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do not have experience with PreFigure, but there is <url href="https://prefigure.org/docs/frontmatter.html">PreFigure documentation</url>
        which includes examples, as well as a <url href="https://davidaustinm.github.io/prefigure/">PreFigure playground</url>.
        If you play around and learn some things, please send me what you learn so I can include it here.
