      <p>
        <url href="https://webwork.maa.org/moodle/">WeBWorK</url> is a web-based system that allows you to write and 
        assign self-graded questions. Student progress can be tracked and imported into Canvas. The 
        <url href="https://wuzzy.natsci.colostate.edu/webwork2">CSU WeBWorK server</url> has a list of existing courses in 
        WeBWorK that can be used and modified. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There are <url href="https://webwork.maa.org/moodle/mod/page/view.php?id=29">built-in accessibility features in WeBWorK</url>.
        The main things to be thoughtful of when writing or using a WeBWorK exercise are the following.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              All math content should be authored in math mode (i.e., enclosing math in <c>\( \)</c>). 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If your exercise contains an image, be sure to write alternate text that includes the information needed from the image
              to answer the question being asked. If you are writing or using questions that have variation, be sure to make your
              alternate text dynamic by using the necessary variables in your image description.
            </p>
